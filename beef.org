* Problems we have with workflow

** ShellTask is "sh" task 
   See [[https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/durabletask/BourneShellScript.java][durabletasks's BourneShellScript.java]] which is utilized by
   [[https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/d6f4a22e0660bce076f733c6c78f3613ef690c50/durable-task-step/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/workflow/steps/durable_task/ShellStep.java#L50][workflow's ShellStep.java]]. 

   We need to see if we can make a clean translation to window's batch
   calling capabilities.

** Workspace is not cleaned on subsequent executions
   If files are created between builds, the files remain (see
   trial-one, script1.sh). The directory reflects the presence of a
   "build file" that should be cleaned up.

*** Can git be cached + =git clean= or something similar

* Questions we have


** Can we integrate and resolve steps from external gradle build files?

** How do we approach loading external files from a repo to form parts of the WF?
